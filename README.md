# Command-Line Calculator

This command-line calculator is a Java project demonstrating various fundamental and advanced programming concepts. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on user-inputted numbers.

## Concepts Covered

The project covers the following programming concepts:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Interfaces
- Encapsulation
- Modular design
- Composition
- Error handling

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following classes and interfaces:

- `Calculator.java`: The main class that handles user input, performs operations, and displays results.
- `InputHandler.java`: A utility class responsible for handling and validating user input.
- `operation.java`: An interface representing an arithmetic operation.
- `Addition.java`: A class implementing the `operation` interface for addition.
- `Subtraction.java`: A class implementing the `operation` interface for subtraction.
- `Multiplication.java`: A class implementing the `operation` interface for multiplication.
- `Division.java`: A class implementing the `operation` interface for division.

## Usage

To use the command-line calculator, compile and run the `Calculator.java` file:

javac Calculator.java
java Calculator
